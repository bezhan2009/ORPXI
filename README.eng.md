**ORPXI** is an alternative command line interface written in the Go programming language. It provides the same basic commands as the standard CMD, but also includes additional commands specific to this tool.

### Features

- **CMD Compatibility**: ORPXI supports most CMD commands, ensuring a smooth transition for users.
- **Additional Commands**: ORPXI includes a range of additional commands designed to simplify everyday tasks for system administrators and developers.
- **Extensibility**: Since ORPXI is written in Go, its functionality can be easily extended by developing custom commands.
- **Performance**: Go is known for its high performance, making ORPXI fast and responsive.
- **Support and Feedback**: Users can contact the developer directly via Telegram.

### Installation and Running

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bezhan2009/ORPXI.git
cd ORPXI
go run .
